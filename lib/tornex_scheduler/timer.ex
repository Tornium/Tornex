  Timer used to determine when to dump all of the buckets, see `Tornex.Scheduler.Bucket`.
  By default, the bucket will be dumped every 6 seconds to allow for a maximum call rate of 
  60 API requests per minute. Upon the dump timer ending, the GenServer will send a `:dump` signal to 
  all GenServers under `Tornex.Scheduler.Supervisor`.
